# Jupyter-Notebook-Started
Interactive console application.

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful way to write and iterate on your Python code for data analysis.
Rather than writing and re-writing an entire program, you can write lines of code and run them one at a time. Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window.

LAUNCH A NOTEBOOK:To launch a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to save your notebook. Then type the command jupyter notebook and the program will instantiate a local server at localhost:8888 (or another specified port).A browser window should immediately pop up with the Jupyter Notebook interface, otherwise, you can use the address it gives you. The notebooks have a unique token since the software uses pre-built Docker containers to put notebooks on their own unique path. To stop the server and shutdown the kernel from the terminal, hit control-C twice.

JUPYTER INTERFACE:Now you’re in the Jupyter Notebook interface, and you can see all of the files in your current directory. All Jupyter Notebooks are identifiable by the notebook icon next to their name. If you already have a Jupyter Notebook in your current directory that you want to view, find it in your files list and click it to open.
To create a new notebook, go to New and select Notebook - Python 3. If you have other Jupyter Notebooks on your system that you want to use, you can click Upload and navigate to that particular file.

INSIDE THE NOTEBOOK:When you open a new Jupyter notebook, you’ll notice that it contains a cell.Cells are how notebooks are structured and are the areas where you write your code. To run a piece of code, click on the cell to select it, then press SHIFT+ENTER or press the play button in the toolbar above. Additionally, the Cell dropdown menu has several options to run cells, including running one cell at a time or to run all cells at once.
After your run a cell, the output of the cell’s code will appear in the space below. To stop running a piece of code, press the stop button.
Jupyter Notebook files are saved as you go. They will exist in your directory as a JSON file with the extension .ipynb. You can also export Jupyter Notebooks in other formats, such as HTML. To do so, go to the File menu, scroll down to Download as and select the type of file you’re looking for. A popup will appear asking where you would like this new file to download. Once you’ve navigated to the appropriate directory, click Save and Checkpoint.
